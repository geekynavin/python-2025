✅ What is a Generator in Python?
A generator is a special type of function that returns values one at a time, using yield instead of return.

It remembers where it left off, so it can continue the next time you ask for a value.

🔁 Think of it like:
A generator is a lazy worker — it does only one thing at a time when asked, instead of doing everything at once like a list.


🔹 Regular Function vs Generator
🔸 Regular function:

def get_numbers():
    return [1, 2, 3]

print(get_numbers())  # ➝ [1, 2, 3]


✅ Real-Life Example: Countdown Generator

def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

for number in countdown(5):
    print(number)


  Output:

5
4
3
2
1
